# Currently Just making list of recipes page. 
### Done so far
- made for loop that populates the screen with tables (each table is a unique item)
- made css for each table and currently displaying an example with fake inputs (in the future we take from the database)

### to-do
- move the recipe page out of the controller folder
- setup the database and input some recipes and plans for testing
- implement the planner
- implement add function
- whole lotta other stuff

## What it looks like now (need food pics)
