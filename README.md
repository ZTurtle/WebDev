- setup the database and input some recipes and plans for testing
- implement the planner
- implement add function
- whole lotta other stuff

# Updates
## Ama (11/01/2024)
- **Huge update on the WebDevProject/Controller/index.php file:** Created $action implementation just like we do in class. Made it as a pull request for you to look at first.
- Registration is fully developed in the back-end. Will take users to homepage (`home.php`) after registering, which is not yet implemented.
- Added a bunch of folders and files I needed for registration/login implementation
- Reorganized the Directory:
  - Anything not that will not be part of the htdocs XAAMP file should be put in the ProjectDocs folder
  - The WebDevProject folder should **only have things that are actually gonna be part of our web application**
- Will be making branch moving forward to finish the login implementation
- Added `.gitignore` file because I needed it for my macOS when working with Git in VSCode

How the Landing Page Currently looks like on my end (using my own main.css file I created).
